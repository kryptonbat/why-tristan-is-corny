<h1 style="font-size: 55px;">Welcome to the gallery of Tristan: Cornball Edition</h1>
<p>By: Paxton P.</p>

<hr>

<p>We all know and hate tristan, so lets go over some of the things that makes him a cornball</p>

<hr>
<img id="swapImage" src="images/tristan_profile-2.png" width="350" height="600">
<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Chapter 1: The Username</h1>
<p>If you direct your attention towards Tristans username, as circled, you will see Japanese lettering</p>
<br>
<img id="swapImage2" src="images/tristan_user-2.png" width="350" height="600">
<br>
<p>Usually, Japanese lettering is used to create an image of a person that is good at videogames</p>
<p>However in Tristans case, he is hot GARBGE at video games, so he has no right having that username</p>
<p> </p>

<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Chapter 2: The Activity</h1>
<p>At the bottom right of Tristans profile picture as circled, you will see a red dash</p>
<br>
<img src="images/tristan_dnd-2.png" width="350" height="600">
<br>
<p>The red dash symbolizes that he is on Do Not Disturb, which means he doesnt get notified when someone texts him</p>
<p>Most people who use this think they are a somebody, but Tristan here is a nobody so again he has no right being on DND</p>
<p> </p>

<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Chapter 3: The Profile Picture</h1>
<p>If you look at the top left of the image as circled, you will see his profile picture</p>
<br>
<img src="images/tristan_pfp-2.png" width="350" height="600">
<br>
<p>When you see an anime profile picture, you immediatly think to yourself, <i>what a loser oh my lord, he must smell like hell.</i></p>
<P>And to that, you would be right. He is one of the worst smelling people of all time, and has dandruff btw</P>
<p> </p>

<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Chapter 4: The Shout</h1>
<p>If you look to the right of the Profile Picture as circled, you will see the shout he has public on his profile.</p>
<br>
<img src="images/tristan_shout-2.png" width="350" height="600">
<br>
<p>You will see the text "what is life without a gf". Matter of fact he does NOT have a girlfriend. If and i mean IF he is</p>
<p>dating someone, it would be a 6'8 femboy therian he met on roblox.</p>
<p> </p>

<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Chapter 5: The tag</h1>
<p>If you look to the right of his username, you will see his tag as circled</p>
<br>
<img src="images/tristan_tag.png" width="350" height="600">
<br>
<p>What his tag reads is "RIZZ" but contradictory to that he has NO skill with talking to women.</p>
<p>Women run away from him when they either see him or smell him</p>
<p> </p>

<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Chapter 6: The Nitro</h1>
<p>If you look to the right of the tag, you will see a nitro symbol as circled</p>
<br>
<img src="images/tristan_nitro.png" width="350" height="600">
<br>
<p>The nitro symbol means he purchased nitro platnium, which means he spend $100 A YEAR of his DADS money and</p>
<p>didnt even customize his profile with nitro features. Not even a streamer by the way ðŸ˜­</p>
<p> </p>

<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Chapter 7: The Discord Orbs</h1>
<p>In the circled area you will find the discord orbs symbol</p>
<br>
<img src="images/tristan_dc_orbs.png" width="350" height="600">
<br>
<p>In this chapter its about the discord orbs symbol. That means that he is an avid discord user. More in depth</p>
<p>it means he spends alot of time doing quests to get discord accesories. This honestly speaks for itself and</p>
<p>is not the best thing to have on your discord profile</p>

<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Chapter 8: The Pronouns</h1>
<p>If you would look to the left of the nitro symbol, you will see his set pronouns as circled</p>
<br>
<img src="images/tristan_pronouns.png" width="350" height="600">
<br>
<p>The pronouns he set were "no". Do i even have to say anything? We all know ts is so corny i dont even know what to say</p>
<p> </p>

<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Chapter 9: The playtime</h1>
<p>If you go down under the username, you will see what hes playing as circled</p>
<br>
<img src="images/tristan_game.png" width="350" height="600">
<br>
<p>First offense: He was playing roblox. Now roblox itself isnt bad, but at the time of screenshot he</p>
<p>was playing The Strongest Battlegrounds ðŸ˜­. Second offense: He was on for 4 AND A HALF HOURS. Dude</p>
<p>spend HALF of his time home from school playing a HORRENDOUS roblox game ðŸ˜­ðŸ’”</p>
<p> </p>

<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Chapter 10: The About Me</h1>
<p>Below the playing window, you will see his about me as circled</p>
<br>
<img src="images/tristan_about_me.png" width="350" height="600">
<br>
<p>In his about me tab, you will see "did you know that i did not ask". oh my 2021 ðŸ˜­ i deadass dont know how</p>
<p>it got this bad but oh my god ts is TERRIBLE. There was no question to say "i did not ask" to, hes just</p>
<p>saying it because hes trying to be "funny" or "quirky" but it just comes up as him looking like a weirdo</p>
<p> </p>

<hr>

<h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Chapter 11: The Join Date\The Finale</h1>
<p>im so done with make this and looking at this profile so imma wrap it up</p>
<br>
<img src="images/tristan_join_date.png" width="350" height="600">
<br>
<p>This time its about the join date. Which is 2015 ðŸ˜­. Just so you know, he was 4 YEARS OLD. I am completely speechless right now,</p>
<p>the first time i saw the profile, i saw the obvious, play time, about me, user, but i didnt know that the join date would</p>
<p>be the worst of it all ðŸ’”.</p>
